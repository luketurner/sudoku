# Sudoku

A Sudoku web app. Works on PC or mobile. Still under development.

Generates puzzles with 25-30 squares filled. All generated puzzles are guaranteed solvable, but it might not be easy.
In terms of most apps, these puzzles are Hard or Very Hard difficulty.

Supports "notes," meaning that you can select multiple numbers in a single square. Notes do not affect puzzle correctness;
they are created by the player purely as a reminder to themselves.

Can also be used as a puzzle solver. Just enter the puzzle manually and press Solve to see the solution.

## To do

* Prettification
* Local storage for game state
* "hints" -- helping the player if they ask for it, without solving the whole puzzle
* Generating with different difficulty levels
